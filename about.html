                It’s an exciting time to be a book reviewer. Once confined to print newspapers and journals, reviews now dot many corridors of the Internet — forever helping others discover their next great read. That said, every book reviewer will face a familiar panic: how can you do justice to a great book in just a thousand words?
            <br>    
                What must a book review contain?
            <br>
                Like all works of art, no two book reviews will be identical. But fear not: there are a few guidelines for any aspiring book reviewer to follow. Most book reviews, for instance, are less than 1,500 words long, with the sweet spot hitting somewhere around the 1,000-word mark. 

                In addition, all book reviews share some universal elements. These include:

                A concise plot summary of the book.
                An evaluation of the work.
                A recommendation for the audience.
                If these are the basic ingredients that make up a book review, it’s the tone and style with which the book reviewer writes that brings the extra panache.   

                Keeping that in mind, let’s proceed to some book review examples to put all of this in action.
